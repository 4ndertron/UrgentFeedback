    Project Ideas:
        BBB API

TODO: Triple Trouble Automation
    - New Account Batches
    - Transfers Cases
    - Continuations/Refiles
TODO: ECL DASHBOARD
TODO: Ratio of Total Installs on Priority Case Report
TODO: Turn all Default WIP_END fields to CLOSED_DATE after collaboration with Brittany
TODO: Update all Default reports with the new WIP_END Field.

TODO: BBB Inflow graph and attach what root cause tags that we do have for 2019. Heatmap inflow? Maybe not, the BBB

TODO: What is the cost, and what did they pay?

Trust LD to do the filings. Not happening. Transfers is suffering.
Agent's don't know where the account is in the filings process.
Give them visibility into Luna.
Just get done within 24 hours.
In Progress, signal brittany to terminate filing. (Default or Transfer case?)
Audit making sure there's TA, original.
Put on spreadsheet & send to LD.
Or they create the termination themselves.
How do you share the workload, while having visibility.
Transfer would be a comment. Release would be a task as SF.
Or take out of Salesforce, into a google sheet.
TODO: Open In Progress, pull out and into the sheet. Batch by time frames. Noon to 4 is LD. All else is VSLR.
Split the batches from LD to filings.
One tab is LD and one is Filings.
LD marks an account complete in the bacth.
Then the SF does not mark the complete.... Need to audit? Or fix?
